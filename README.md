# üéìüéì Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ Data Modelling

Welcome to the **Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢ Data Modelling** workshop! In this two-hour workshop, we show the methodoloy to build an effective data model with distributed `NoSQL database Apache Cassandra‚Ñ¢`.

Using **Astra DB**, the cloud based _Cassandra-as-a-Service_ platform delivered by DataStax, we will cover the process for every developer who wants to build an applications: list the use case and build an effective data model.

## 2. Frequently asked questions

<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need the following:
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 2Ô∏è‚É£ What other prerequisites are required?</b></summary>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>You will need enough *real estate* on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK)
<li>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following
<li>As "Intermediate level" we expect you to know what java and Spring are. 
</ul>
</p>
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 3Ô∏è‚É£ Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</b></summary>
<hr>
<b>No.</b> All tools and services we provide here are FREE. FREE not only during the session but also after.
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 4Ô∏è‚É£ Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</b></summary>
<hr>
Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the homework detailed below and you will get a nice badge that you can share on linkedin or anywhere else *(open badge specification)*

## 4. Create your Astra DB instance

_**`ASTRA DB`** is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you end your credits the databases will pause, no charge_

Leveraging [Database creation guide](https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure) create a database. *Right-Click the button* with *Open in a new TAB.*

<a href="https://astra.dev/2-16"><img src="images/create_astra_db_button.png?raw=true" /></a>

|Field|Value|
|---|---|
|**Database Name**| `workshops`|
|**Keyspace Name**| `sensor_data`|
|**Regions**| Select `GOOGLE CLOUD`, then an Area close to you, then a region with no LOCKER üîí icons, those are the region you can use for free.   |

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:** If you already have a database `workshops`, simply add a keyspace `sensor_data` using the `Add Keyspace` button on the bottom right hand corner of db dashboard page.

While the database is being created, you will also get a **Security token**:
save it somewhere safe, as it will be needed to later in others workshop (In particular the string starting with `AstraCS:...`.)

The status will change from `Pending` to `Active` when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.

## 5. Working with Data types

### ‚úÖ Step 5a. `List` Collections

üìò **Command to execute**

```sql
// Definition
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_with_list (
  uid      uuid,
  items    list<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY (uid)
);

// Insert
INSERT INTO table_with_list(uid,items) 
VALUES (c7133017-6409-4d7a-9479-07a5c1e79306, ['a', 'b', 'c']);

// Replace
UPDATE table_with_list SET items = ['d', 'e'] 
WHERE uid = c7133017-6409-4d7a-9479-07a5c1e79306;

// Show result
SELECT * FROM table_with_list ;

// Append to list
UPDATE table_with_list SET items = items + ['f']
WHERE uid = c7133017-6409-4d7a-9479-07a5c1e79306;

// Replace an element (not available in Astra because read before write)
UPDATE table_with_list SET items[0] = ['g']
WHERE uid = c7133017-6409-4d7a-9479-07a5c1e79306;
```

### ‚úÖ Step 5b. `Set` Collections

üìò **Command to execute**

```sql
// Definition
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_with_set (
  uid      uuid,
  animals  set<text>,
  PRIMARY KEY (uid)
);

// Insert
INSERT INTO table_with_set(uid,animals) 
VALUES (87fad746-4adf-4107-9858-df8643564186, {'spider', 'cat', 'dog'});

// Replace
UPDATE table_with_set SET animals = {'pangolin', 'bat'}
WHERE uid = 87fad746-4adf-4107-9858-df8643564186;

// Show result

```sql
// Definition
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_with_map (
  uid         text,
  dictionary  map<text, text>,
  PRIMARY KEY (uid)
);

// Insert
INSERT INTO table_with_map(uid, dictionary) 
VALUES ('fr_en', {'fromage':'cheese', 'vin':'wine', 'pain':'bread'});

WHERE uid = 'fr_en';

// Show result
SELECT * FROM table_with_map;

CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS udt_address (
  street text,
  city text,
  state text,
);

// Use the UDT in a table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_with_udt (
  uid      text,
  adress   udt_address,
  PRIMARY KEY (uid)
);

// INSERT (not quote on field names like street)
INSERT INTO table_with_udt(uid, adress) 
VALUES ('superman', {street:'daily planet',city:'metropolis',state:'CA'});

// Replace
UPDATE table_with_udt 
SET adress = {street:'pingouin alley',city:'antarctica',state:'melting'}
WHERE uid = 'superman';

// Replace 1 fields
UPDATE table_with_udt 
SET adress.state = 'melt'
WHERE uid = 'superman';
```

### ‚úÖ Step 5e. Counters

üìò **Command to execute**

```sql
// Definition
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS table_with_counters (
  handle        text,
  following     counter,
  followers     counter,

);

// You have a new follower
UPDATE table_with_counters SET followers = followers + 1
WHERE  handle = 'clunven';

// Some counters are‚Ä¶ null
SELECT * from table_with_counters;

// Set to 0‚Ä¶but set is not valid
UPDATE table_with_counters 
SET following = following + 0, notifications = notifications + 0
WHERE handle = 'clunven';

// Following someone
UPDATE table_with_counters SET following = following + 1
WHERE handle = 'clunven';

// You have a new message
UPDATE table_with_counters SET notifications = notifications + 1
WHERE handle = 'clunven';

```

## 6. Create Sensor Tables

üìò **Command to execute**

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS networks (
  name        TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  region      TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY ((name))

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sensors_by_network (
  network         TEXT,
  sensor          TEXT,
  latitude        DECIMAL,
  longitude       DECIMAL,
  characteristics MAP<TEXT,TEXT>,
  PRIMARY KEY ((network),sensor)
);

CREATE TABLE temperatures_by_sensor (
  sensor TEXT,
  date DATE,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  value FLOAT,
  PRIMARY KEY ((sensor, date),timestamp)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (timestamp DESC);

CREATE TABLE temperatures_by_network (
  network TEXT,

  sensor TEXT,
  avg_temperature FLOAT,
  latitude DECIMAL,
  longitude DECIMAL,
  PRIMARY KEY ((network,week),date_hour,sensor)

```

## 7. KDM Data Tools


## 8. Homework

To submit the **homework**, please take a screenshot of the CQL Console showing the rows in tables
`table_with_udt` and `table_with_counters` before _and_ after executing the DELETE statements.

You should also complete two mini-courses (a few minutes each) about using CQL and designing tables:

- Complete the mini-course "Cassandra Data Modeling / Digital Library": [lessons](https://www.datastax.com/learn/data-modeling-by-example/digital-library-data-model) and [practice](https://killercoda.com/datastaxdevs/course/cassandra-data-modeling/music-data). Take a screenshot of the final screen of the practice, with the console output at the right.

Don't forget to [submit your homework](https://forms.gle/Z69y4MM3SpEDg7nt5) and be awarded a nice verified badge!

## 9. What's NEXT ?

We've just scratched the surface of what you can do using Astra DB, built on Apache Cassandra.

Go take a look at [DataStax for Developers](https://www.datastax.com/dev) to see what else is possible.
There's plenty to dig into!

Congratulations: you made to the end of today's workshop.
